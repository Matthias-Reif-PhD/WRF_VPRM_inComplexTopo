# P-Model Analysis

## Overview

This folder contains exploratory analyses related to the P-Model (Photosynthesis Model), a process-based model for estimating gross primary productivity (GPP) based on plant physiology and environmental conditions.

## Contents

The folder includes:
- **Data files and scripts** for testing and comparing P-Model predictions against observed and modeled GPP data from WRF simulations
- **Jupyter notebooks** for interactive exploration and visualization of model results
- **Configuration files** (e.g., `pyrealm_environment.yml`) for setting up the Python environment needed to run P-Model analyses

## Important Note

**This analysis was NOT included in the final paper publication.** These are exploratory/supplementary analyses that were conducted during the research process but did not make it into the main manuscript.

However, the code and results here may still be useful for:
- Understanding alternative approaches to GPP estimation
- Exploring model sensitivities and uncertainties
- Extending the analysis with additional validation approaches
- Curious minds interested in the research process beyond what was published
